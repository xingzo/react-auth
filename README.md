# Basic Routing with Auth

There are 2 branches to review: basic-routes and auth-routes.

## Basic Routes

Extremely simplified demonstration of configuring routing for your site.

## Auth Routes

Simplified demo of adding authentication and authorization to your routes.

**Instructions**
Download and install the app. Then open it in your browser.
* Open your React Console in the browser and open up the components.
* Open the `<App />` component in the console.
* You'll see the toggles for turning auth on and off. Toggle it.

This will show you links appearing and disappearing based on auth status!

Note: This demo does NOT hit a live api. Students will need to plug that in themselves.
